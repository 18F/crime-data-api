This is the process to update the yearly UCR data for the FBI Crime Data Explorer.  
  
(1) Put data dump.tar.gz into crime-data-api/dba/update/data/ 
    # See crime-data-api/dba/update/data/samples for example template files.  
    # Each one MUST be present inside of dump.tar.gz
    # + The number of columns, and column order should match.  
   
(2) Modify upload_data_manifest.yml, update_nibrs_manifest.yml, update_reta_manifest.yml  -> replace year with current update year. Ie. 2016  
(3) Run: cf push -f ~/crime-data-api/upload_data_manifest.yml --health-check-type none --no-route   
    # Monitor the logs with cf logs task-runner-update --recent  
  
(4) After job is finished - Run: cf delete task-runner-update  
(5) Run: cf push -f ~/crime-data-api/update_nibrs_manifest.yml --health-check-type none --no-route  
    # Monitor the logs with cf logs task-runner-update --recent  
    # Wait for script to finish. Monitor output. Verify results in the database.   
  
(6) After job is finished - Run: cf delete task-runner-update  
(7) Run: cf push -f ~/crime-data-api/update_reta_manifest.yml --health-check-type none --no-route    
    # Monitor the logs with cf logs task-runner-update --recent   
    # Wait for script to finish. Monitor output. Verify results in the database.   
  
(7) After job is finished - Run: cf delete task-runner-update  
(8) Run: cf push -f ~/crime-data-api/finalize_update.yml --health-check-type none --no-route    
    # Monitor the logs with cf logs task-runner-update --recent   
    # Wait for script to finish. Monitor output. Verify results in the database.   

-- (After successful update) --   
  
(9) Run: cd /crime-data-api/dba/update/ && ./update_files_s3.sh  
    # update_files_s3.sh updates the NIBRS Incident archives, and other additional data downloads.  
    # Note: This will require cf connect-to-service, access to s3, and the aws s3 CLI utility installed locally. 
    # See: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/
(10) Verify the data + Enable the new year in the front end application: See https://github.com/18F/crime-data-explorer/
