        Multiple tools continously statically and dynamically scan the application. Static scans include Bandit, Code Climate, and Gemnasium. CircleCI dynamically scans the application using multiple unit test. Scans are trigged upon each pull request, and badges reflecting the status of the "master" branch are posted at the top of the code repository's README file.
